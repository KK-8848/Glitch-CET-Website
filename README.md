# Glitch CET
Glitch CET is the first game development club at the College of Engineering Trivandrum. 
We are a group of students brought together by a shared love for games, combining creativity, technology, and storytelling.

We code with passion, create with purpose, and grow together by solving challenges as a team.

From design and development to art, sound, and story, we explore every part of what makes a game come to life. Whether you're just getting started or already experienced, you'll find a space here to learn, build, and belong.

Let’s build games. Let’s build the future.
